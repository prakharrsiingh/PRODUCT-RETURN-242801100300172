Product Return Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict whether a product will be returned based on key features such as review score, purchase amount, and delivery time. The goal of this project is to assist e-commerce businesses in understanding return behavior and reducing return rates, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business profitability.

Project Overview
The prediction model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble machine learning algorithm. The dataset used includes transaction data with the following features:

Review Score: Customer rating for the product.

Purchase Amount: The total amount paid for the product.

Days to Delivery: The number of days it took for the product to be delivered.

The model is trained to predict whether a product is likely to be returned based on these features, helping businesses flag potential returns proactively.

Key Features
Random Forest Classifier:

A versatile and powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

Provides feature importance scores to understand which factors contribute most to product returns.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values by imputing with the median value.

Feature scaling to standardize numerical features and ensure model stability.

Model Evaluation:

Performance is assessed using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

A confusion matrix is generated to visualize model performance.

Visualization:

Plots of feature importance to gain insights into what drives product return predictions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

Libraries:

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-return-prediction.git
cd product-return-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Code
To run the model, execute the following Python script:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python return_prediction.py
This will:

Load and clean the data

Train the machine learning model

Evaluate performance using classification metrics and confusion matrix

Plot feature importance to visualize the key factors affecting product return likelihood

Output
After running the script, you will see the following outputs:

Classification Report: Displays Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model performance.

Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true vs. predicted labels for the test data.

Feature Importance Plot: Bar plot showing the importance of each feature in predicting product returns.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model (product_return.csv) contains the following columns:

purchase_amount: The amount paid for the product.

review_score: The rating given by the customer.

days_to_delivery: Number of days the product took to be delivered.

returned: The target variable indicating if the product was returned (1 if returned, 0 if not).
